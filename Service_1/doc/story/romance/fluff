Our first date was a joke. 
It almost seemed illegal. Probably was. 
But it was the third best day of my life. 
Second was him saying he loved me. 
First being the day we got married. 


(Past, memory)
London wasn't cursed with rain that night. It was almost midnight. ___ and /// came to a place where they offered boat hiring.

“We’re just borrowing it,” he smirked, pulling her along. 
They sneaked onto the mini boat with their picnic basket. 
/// started the engine and the boat was on the move. He then sat back down and faced her while reaching out for her hand. 
___ looked up at the sky and muttered, “It would have been nice to be graced by the stars.” 
/// bit the corner of his lips as he moved to sit beside ___. He combed her hair back behind her ears and drew his face closer to hers. 
“Close your eyes and imagine them,” he aired as his lips closed in on hers. 

“Did you see them? The star,” /// asked, finally breaking away from the haven her touch gave him. 
___ shook her head, shyly. “You made it hard for me to even think about them,” she said, softly. 
“Well, let me make it harder,” he teased as he sank in to steal another taste of her lips.

That day was so special. 
Everything was perfect. 
Those moments were the times I felt complete. 
Those moments made me forget the dark phases.

I told him how hard the two years without him were.
The two years of not knowing how he felt. 
The two years of me packing up my feelings into a small hard box. 
Telling him that finally gave me an opportunity to comfort him. 
My husband. 


(Past, memory)
“Oh-ho look at my princess in distress,” ___ said. 
“Shut up, you’re the princess!” /// shouted, though his voice cracked. He sat on the bed, leaning against the wall for the support he needed to take all this in. 
“So, if this princess asked you to do something, will you do it?” ___ sat beside him, leaning her head against his shoulders. 
“Of course, I will. Just tell me what it is,” he whispered as he kissed her hair. 

After a long moment of silence, ___ looked up and grasped his face into her hands. 
Staring deep into his eyes, she started, “I want you to forget what I told you. I wanted you to know how I felt in those two years to show you how I much loved you from day one. So, please. For me, just forget and let’s continue our lives as husband a-”
“And princess,” he finished, in the tone of voice he used when he had just finished crying. 


(Present)
The same tone he used when he said I do. 


(Past, memory)
“So do you, /// Riggs, accept ___ James with all your heart and soul?”
“Yes, yes I do.”
“Do you, ___ James, accept /// Riggs with all your heart and soul?”


(Present)
I do. 
I shut my eyes then reopened them to see /// lying, still, on his hospital bed beside mine. I reached out my old, full of folds, hand to his granddad ones. 
I would love to spend eternity with him.
But old age. 
But old age will always get in the way. 
I had a tight grip of his hand as I took my last breath in this world. 
In this world full of memories.
Memories I remember.
I remember…
