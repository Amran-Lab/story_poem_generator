Sorrow

Like a curse, it came haunting.
Like snow, it was temporary.
But like a cut, a scar was left.  

Anguish, and pain,
Words that run around my vein. 
Hatred, and fear,
Made my wretched mind go clear. 

Smoke surrounds me, 
That smell that brings memories.
Let the innocent be,
Our young years screams. 

Ashtrays had a better life,
Inanimate, they couldn't feel. 
Us, we suffered.
