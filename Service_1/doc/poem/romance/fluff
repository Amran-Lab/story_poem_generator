Fluff

It was Christmas Eve,
Cherry blossom leaves.
Something is up their sleeve. 
The lover believes.

Anniversary dinner, 
Just a regular winter.
In the middle of a shiver, 
The lights grew dimmer. 

Surprise, surprise. 
Unexpected prize.
At their great tries, 
The lover cries. 

For the better, 
A new pleasure.
Here comes a member,
Sealing the deal forever.
